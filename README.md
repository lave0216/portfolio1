# Marielle Laverdure Portfolio

## Project Description
In this project I used what I designed and prototype din my User Experience class. I took and applied it here while coding it. This website is nice and easy to undersatnd with a minimalistic touch. This webiste is animated, interactive and user friendly. I had to make minor adjustments fro the UX design/prototype to make it nicer.
